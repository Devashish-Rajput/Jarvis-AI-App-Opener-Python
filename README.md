<h2>S Button is for taking screenshot of whole screen</h2>
<h2>Y Button is for closing the script or you can add some extra functionality</h2>
<h2>R Button is for closing the script or you can add some extra functionality</h2>
<h2>L Button is for listening what you say as soon as button is pressed you need to speak the app name which is stored in apps shortcut folder. You need create your own shortcuts right now my shortcuts are added there delete them and add new shortcuts with your required apps or even folder shortcuts </h2>


<h1> Extras</h1>
<h2> ->You can schedule the script so that it can start when your computer starts up. </h2> 
<h2> ->These buttons will always be on top no matter which app you open. </h2>
<h2> ->You can even change its position wherever you are comfortable for it</h2>
<h2> ->Right now it does not close apps you can add that functionality to but it will be quite complicated. </h2>
